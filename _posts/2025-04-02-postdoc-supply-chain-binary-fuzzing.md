We have one fully-funded open position to <strong>work for 2 years as a postdoc in the [SECUBIC project][secubic], on analyzing and fuzzing binaries to prevent backdoors and other supply-chain attacks. </strong>.

<strong>TITLE</strong> - Binary analysis to prevent supply-chain attacks.

<strong>TOPIC</strong> - Infrastructure appliances (like routers or CCTV systems) are equipped with computer code in binary format ensuring their operation. This code may embed up to thousands of pre-existing software components, whose (open source) code was openly available on the Internet. This opens the door to so-called supply-chain attacks, like [backdoor attacks][icse25]. The [SECUBIC project][secubic] aims at increasing the detection capabilities of such vulnerabilities. As a part of this effort, you will push further our existing work on the matter ([ICSE'25][icse25]) and develop new fuzzing and static analysis techniques to prevent supply-chain attacks.  

<strong>KEYWORDS</strong> - software supply-chain security, backdoors, fuzzing, static analysis, binary analysis

<strong>SUPERVISION</strong> - Supervision will be provided by [Michaël Marcozzi][marcozzi]. The postdoc will involve interactions with the other members of the [SECUBIC project][secubic] and their teams: [Sébastien Bardin][bardin], [Jean-Yves Marion][marion] and [Stefano Zacchiroli][zacchiroli].

<strong>HOSTING</strong> - You will be hosted in the [BINSEC team][website], part of the CEA List institute of Université Paris-Saclay, located in the [Paris-Saclay research cluster][nano].

<strong>To apply, please check out the [detailed application procedure and job info][procedure]</strong>.

<strong>When to apply</strong> - As soon as possible! We process applications as soon as they arrive (depending on our own availability ^^), so don't be too late.
